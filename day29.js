// --- Day 29: Course Schedule ---

// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 

// Example 1:

// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
//              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

// Example 2:

// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
//              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
//              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 
// Constraints:

// The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
// You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
// 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5

// ----------

// first, create a reverse adjacency list based on the dependencies. this way, we can look in O(1) time to see which prerequisites a course will have. then do a DFS topological sort on the graph
// represented by the adjacency list - for any node we visit, first we will recurse on its prerequisites. every time we visit a node, we first mark it "gray" in a `seen` object. while recursing up
// a chain of prerequisites, we should not encounter a gray node - if we do, then we have found a cycle. once we find a node that has no prerequisites, we can mark it "black" in the `seen` object.
// in order to do this DFS, we use a helper function whose purpose it is to visit a given node. this function also returns a boolean for whether there is an absence of a cycle (`false` means there is
// a cycle, while `true` means there is not). first the helper checks if we have already seen this node - if so, and it's gray, then we return `false` (cycle detected), or else it's black and we 
// return `true`. if it's not in the `seen` object, we mark it as gray, and then recurse through all of its prerequisites first. (if any of those come back `false`, we also return `false`.) once we
// finish that process we are ready to mark this node as black and return `true`. in the main function, then, we simply iterate through all our courses and call `helper` on them. if at any point we
// get a `false` result then a cycle was detected, so we ultimately return `false`. else, we ultimately return `true`.
